  <h1 id="headingone">I love cats</h1>
  <p id="indentpara">My first memory of a cat was my childhood best friend's cat's funeral. We buried him in the common area outside. Shortly after she had a new cat and whenever they'd travel to see family, my elder sister would feed him.</p>
  <p>Kaptein Knirk was deathly afraid of us. It did not help that we knew nothing about cats and did everything in our misguided power to ensure he hated us. But at least he ate his food and drank his water.</p>

    <p>Almost 30 years later, I still haven't raised my own cat, but I have catsat many. I'm proud to say they've all loved me so far. I see that as a forgiveness for how my 5 year-old brain caused a ruckus for Kaptein Knirk.</p>
    <h2>What I love about cats</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Their purring is relaxing,</li>
      <li>They do funny and unexpected things.</li>
      <li>You must earn their trust.</li>
      <li>Most of them don't try to lick you constantly. I like dogs but I really dislike that part. It's non-stop.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>What the future holds</h2>
  <p>I hope one day I can adopt my own cats to look after. My favourite activity is having naps with cats.</p>
